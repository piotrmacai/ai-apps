## 🛠 Methodology: "Vibe Coding"
Most applications in this repository were developed using **High-Velocity Engineering** techniques. By leveraging tools like **Cursor AI, Vercel v0, and Google AI Studio**, I focus on:
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Moving from idea to functional MVP in hours.
- **AI-Augmented Development:** Using LLMs to handle boilerplate, allowing me to focus on system architecture and agent logic.
- **Instant Implementation:** Seamlessly bridging the gap between AI prompt engineering and production-ready code.
